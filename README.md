#Discount Calculator

This Python script calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. It is designed to demonstrate a simple conditional logic function.
How to Run

    Save the Python code as a file (e.g., calculate_discount.py).

    Open a terminal or command prompt.

    Run the script by typing:
    python calculate_discount.py

    Follow the prompts to enter the original price and the discount percentage.

Logic

The script contains a function called calculate_discount that takes two arguments: price and discount_percent.

    If the discount_percent is 20 or higher, the function will apply the discount and return the new, lower price.

    If the discount_percent is less than 20, the function will not apply any discount and will return the original price.
