<h1>Discount Calculator</h1>

<p>This Python script calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. It is designed to demonstrate a simple conditional logic function.
How to Run</p>

   <ul>Save the Python code as a file (e.g., calculate_discount.py).

  <li>  Open a terminal or command prompt.</li>

   <li> Run the script by typing:</li>
   <li> python calculate_discount.py</li>
</ul>
   <p> Follow the prompts to enter the original price and the discount percentage.</p>

<h1>Logic</h1>

The script contains a function called calculate_discount that takes two arguments: price and discount_percent.

   <ol> If the discount_percent is 20 or higher, the function will apply the discount and return the new, lower price.</ol>

   <ol> If the discount_percent is less than 20, the function will not apply any discount and will return the original price.</ol>
